00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I have to present my project, so basically I have made up something called e-commerce,

00:08.000 --> 00:17.000
it is similar to the blanket you know, so let me show you the project, it is not working properly

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
since I have made it a long ago and technology is got a little bit out of order, so first I have to log out here.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Yeah, you can see that there is an option to either log in or register.

00:33.000 --> 00:50.000
So, starting from the first, let me register myself, also, yeah.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
So, as you can see, it is already as user already exists.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
So, let me enter it again in the login section, yeah, I have login successfully.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
So, here we should get the product, but I do not know due to some bugs, I am not getting the product.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
So, here you can see I am getting all the product in the search section.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
So, suppose if I have to buy this, I will add it to the cart, I will add this to the cart here, you can see,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
there are the two items which I added in the cart.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Now, coming to the payment, when I click on the proceed, I will get the option to add address

01:34.000 --> 01:42.000
or select any address which I have entered previously, then after that here will be the total summary of the cart.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
And now, if I can pay online either or cash on delivery.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
So, if I select transaction delivery, it will be order successfully.

01:51.000 --> 02:02.000
Not only that, if I somehow go to the, sorry, yeah, here you can see.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
Like if I added product in the cart and pay on select to pay online, I will get the functionality.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
To pay either by card or card or UPI.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
Coming to the text stack I used, I have made it on the month that stack.

02:21.000 --> 02:32.000
So, like react and a tailwind CSS for the front end and express and more JS for the back end, yeah.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
And I also used MongoDB as a database.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Coming to the functionality, yeah.

02:40.000 --> 02:51.000
So, here you can see, there is a main JS, I have containered all the functionality inside a wrapper.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
And I have also used to store for the notification.

02:56.000 --> 03:09.000
I have made the admin base access that is admin will gets option to add product or delayed product and dashboard for the, you have seen that as podium.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
There are multiple routes like multiple pages that come under the routes.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
That product, this play product admin, the product admin will get the functionality to add the product.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
It's detailed and it's photo.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
My data has been already lost.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
So, I have no images to show right here, but I have done it in the past.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So, this was my all product.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
I have made the whole user authentication and user authorization.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Forward the term user authorization.

03:48.000 --> 03:59.000
So, it is a role based access e-commerce platform, which I have made by myself to help from some little bit help from the guy.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
This is my saved address.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
It was all about my product.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hope you liked it.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
If you liked it, please revert with a simple feedback about it.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Thank you.
