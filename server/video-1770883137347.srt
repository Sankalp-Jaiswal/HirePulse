1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I have to present my project, so basically I have made up something called e-commerce,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
it is similar to the blanket you know, so let me show you the project, it is not working properly

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
since I have made it a long ago and technology is got a little bit out of order, so first I have to log out here.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, you can see that there is an option to either log in or register.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, starting from the first, let me register myself, also, yeah.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, as you can see, it is already as user already exists.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, let me enter it again in the login section, yeah, I have login successfully.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, here we should get the product, but I do not know due to some bugs, I am not getting the product.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So, here you can see I am getting all the product in the search section.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, suppose if I have to buy this, I will add it to the cart, I will add this to the cart here, you can see,

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
there are the two items which I added in the cart.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, coming to the payment, when I click on the proceed, I will get the option to add address

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
or select any address which I have entered previously, then after that here will be the total summary of the cart.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And now, if I can pay online either or cash on delivery.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, if I select transaction delivery, it will be order successfully.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Not only that, if I somehow go to the, sorry, yeah, here you can see.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Like if I added product in the cart and pay on select to pay online, I will get the functionality.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
To pay either by card or card or UPI.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Coming to the text stack I used, I have made it on the month that stack.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, like react and a tailwind CSS for the front end and express and more JS for the back end, yeah.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I also used MongoDB as a database.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Coming to the functionality, yeah.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, here you can see, there is a main JS, I have containered all the functionality inside a wrapper.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I have also used to store for the notification.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I have made the admin base access that is admin will gets option to add product or delayed product and dashboard for the, you have seen that as podium.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are multiple routes like multiple pages that come under the routes.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That product, this play product admin, the product admin will get the functionality to add the product.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's detailed and it's photo.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My data has been already lost.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, I have no images to show right here, but I have done it in the past.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, this was my all product.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have made the whole user authentication and user authorization.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Forward the term user authorization.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So, it is a role based access e-commerce platform, which I have made by myself to help from some little bit help from the guy.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is my saved address.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It was all about my product.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hope you liked it.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you liked it, please revert with a simple feedback about it.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you.
